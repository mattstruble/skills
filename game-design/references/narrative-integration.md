## The Narrative Problem in Games

Games are not movies. The player has agency; the author does not have full control. This is not a limitation to work around — it's the defining characteristic of the medium. The narrative problem in games is not "how do we tell a story?" but "how do we create a meaningful experience when the player is also an author?"

Most game narratives fail not because of bad writing, but because the embedded story and the emergent story conflict. The designer writes a narrative about sacrifice and loss; the gameplay rewards hoarding and optimization. The designer writes a narrative about a lone hero; the gameplay gives the player an army. The words say one thing; the rules say another.

**The fundamental tension**: Authored experience (designer-controlled narrative) vs. emergent experience (narrative arising from gameplay dynamics). Both are always present. The question is whether they harmonize or conflict.

---

## Embedded vs. Emergent Narrative

### Embedded Narrative

Designer-authored story delivered through cutscenes, dialogue, environmental storytelling, and scripted events. The designer controls the content, the sequence, and the emotional beats.

Embedded narrative is the story the designer intended. It has characters, themes, and a plot. It can be written, directed, and polished like any other narrative medium.

**Strengths**: Precise emotional control. The designer can craft specific moments, specific revelations, specific emotional beats. The story can be as complex and nuanced as any novel or film.

**Weaknesses**: The player is a passenger. Agency is suspended during cutscenes. The player's choices may not affect the story. The embedded narrative can feel disconnected from the gameplay experience.

### Emergent Narrative

Story arising from the dynamics of play — the Player-Subject's journey through the system. No designer wrote this story; it emerged from the rules.

Emergent narrative is the story the player lived. It has no characters in the traditional sense — the player IS the protagonist. It has no written plot — the plot is what happened during play.

**Strengths**: Deeply personal. The player owns this story because they created it. Emergent narratives are often more memorable than embedded ones because they were experienced, not observed.

**Weaknesses**: Unpredictable. The designer cannot guarantee specific emotional beats. The emergent story might be trivial, incoherent, or contradictory to the intended experience.

### The Interaction Between Them

Both embedded and emergent narratives have dramatic arcs, emotional content, and sequences. Both contribute to the player's overall narrative experience. The interaction between them is what matters.

When they harmonize, the game feels cohesive — the story the player lived reinforces the story the designer told. When they conflict, the player perceives inconsistency — the game is saying two different things simultaneously.

**The design question**: Does the emergent narrative reinforce the embedded narrative, or does it contradict it?

## Ludo-Narrative Coherence

**Source:** Clint Hocking (2007). "Ludonarrative Dissonance in BioShock." Applied here via the DDE framework.

**Ludo-narrative dissonance** occurs when the embedded narrative and the emergent narrative conflict. The game's story says one thing; the game's rules reward the opposite.

### The DDE Structural Explanation

From the DDE framework (see `frameworks.md` if not already loaded): the **Antagonist** is the game conceived as a unified challenge-entity — the sum of enemy AI, level design, physics, time pressure, and resource scarcity. The Antagonist is not a character; it's the game's resistance to the player's goals.

Ludo-narrative dissonance occurs when the Antagonist becomes inconsistent. The embedded narrative (Blueprint layer in DDE) says the Antagonist represents one thing; the dynamics (Dynamics layer) make the Antagonist behave like something else. The player receives two contradictory signals about what the game is.

### Common Causes

- **Reward structures contradict narrative themes**: The story is about the cost of violence; the gameplay rewards efficient killing. The story is about community and cooperation; the gameplay rewards solo optimization.
- **The player's emergent story is more interesting than the authored one**: The player's improvised narrative — the unexpected alliance, the near-death escape, the strategic gamble — overshadows the scripted story. This isn't always a failure, but it often means the scripted story is fighting for attention it can't win.
- **Mechanics undermine narrative stakes**: Player death is narratively permanent (the story treats death as meaningful) but mechanically temporary (the player reloads and tries again). The mechanical reality contradicts the narrative claim.
- **Forced choices that contradict player agency**: The game moralizes at the player for choices the game forced them to make. The Player-Subject is blamed for the designer's decisions.

### Design Strategies

- **Align reward structures with narrative themes**: If the story is about sacrifice, reward sacrifice. If the story is about community, reward cooperation. The rules should teach the same lesson as the story.
- **Make narrative stakes match mechanical stakes**: If death is narratively meaningful, make it mechanically meaningful (permadeath, significant setbacks). If death is mechanically trivial, don't pretend it's narratively significant.
- **Let the Player-Subject's emergent journey reinforce the authored story**: Design the rules so that the natural emergent narrative aligns with the intended themes. Don't fight the dynamics — use them.
- **Acknowledge the Player-Subject's autonomy**: If the game gives the player choices, respect those choices. Don't moralize at the player for making the choices the game offered.

## The Player-Subject and Narrative

**Source:** Sicart (2009), integrated into DDE.

See the "DDE Framework" section in `frameworks.md` if not already loaded for full DDE context.

The **Player-Subject** is the mental persona that plays the game — not the full human, but a subset with different abilities, ethics, and risk tolerance. The Player-Subject can make decisions the real person never would: betray an ally, sacrifice a unit, make a morally questionable choice to see what happens.

### Why the Player-Subject Matters for Narrative

The Player-Subject is a protective layer that enables the player to engage with the game's narrative without full personal investment. This is why moral choices in games work — the Player-Subject has different ethics. The player can choose to be cruel in a game without feeling cruel as a person.

This is also why some moral choices fail. When the game doesn't acknowledge the Player-Subject's autonomy — when it forces choices, moralizes at the player, or treats the Player-Subject's decisions as the player's personal moral failures — the protective layer breaks. The player feels attacked rather than engaged.

### The Antagonist as Narrative Entity

The Antagonist (the game's unified challenge-entity) generates narrative even in games with no authored story. A player who overcomes a difficult challenge has lived a story: they faced adversity, they struggled, they succeeded. The emergent narrative of "I overcame this challenge" is a complete narrative arc.

This is why games with minimal authored narrative can still feel narratively rich. Dark Souls has almost no explicit story, but every player has a story about their playthrough — the boss that killed them twenty times, the moment they finally understood the pattern, the triumph of the final victory. The Antagonist generated that narrative without a single cutscene.

**Design implication**: A consistent, worthy Antagonist generates narrative automatically. The designer doesn't need to write the story — they need to create a challenge that produces a meaningful arc when overcome.

### Moral Choices and the Player-Subject

Moral choice systems work when they engage the Player-Subject's decision-making without breaking the protective layer. The player should feel the weight of the choice without feeling personally judged for it.

**Failure mode 1**: The choice is illusory. Both options lead to the same outcome. The Player-Subject made a decision that didn't matter — the game was pretending to offer agency.

**Failure mode 2**: The game moralizes at the player after the choice. The Player-Subject made a decision within the game's offered framework; the game then tells the player they made the wrong choice. This breaks the protective layer.

**Failure mode 3**: The choice is forced. The game presents a "choice" that is actually mandatory. The Player-Subject is blamed for a decision the designer made.

## The DDE Three Journeys

From the DDE framework (Walk, Görlich, Barrett 2017): the player is always on three simultaneous journeys. Good narrative design harmonizes them. Poor narrative design lets them conflict.

### Sensory Journey

Everything the player sees, hears, and senses from start to finish. The visual design, sound design, music, UI — all of it contributes to the sensory journey.

The sensory journey is the most immediate layer. A visually stunning cutscene that interrupts a tense gameplay moment is a sensory experience that conflicts with the emotional journey (the tension is broken). A piece of music that swells at the wrong moment undermines the intellectual journey (the player is trying to think, not feel).

### Emotional Journey (Cerebellar)

Fears, joys, tensions, and triumphs experienced during play. The emotional journey is generated by the dynamics — by what happens during play, not by what the designer wrote.

The emotional journey is where fiero lives (see the "Lazzaro's 4 Keys to More Emotion" section in `frameworks.md` if not already loaded). It's also where dread, curiosity, and attachment live. A game that generates rich emotional dynamics without authored narrative is still delivering an emotional journey.

**Narrative integration point**: The embedded narrative should amplify the emotional journey, not interrupt it. A cutscene that delivers an emotional beat the player has already earned through play is powerful. A cutscene that delivers an emotional beat the player hasn't earned feels manipulative.

### Intellectual Journey (Cerebral)

Challenges contemplated, strategies formed, decisions weighed. The intellectual journey is the player's engagement with the game as a system — the reasoning, the planning, the problem-solving.

The intellectual journey is where depth lives (see `depth-and-dynamics.md` if not already loaded). A game with rich intellectual engagement is delivering an intellectual journey even if the embedded narrative is thin.

**Narrative integration point**: Narrative that requires intellectual engagement — mysteries to solve, systems to understand, lore to piece together — can serve both the intellectual and emotional journeys simultaneously. Environmental storytelling (item placement, architectural decay, incidental dialogue) delivers narrative through the intellectual journey rather than interrupting it.

### Harmonizing the Three Journeys

The three journeys are always happening simultaneously. Conflicts between them are the primary source of narrative failure:

- An emotionally tense moment interrupted by a trivial puzzle (emotional journey vs. intellectual journey)
- A visually spectacular cutscene during a moment of quiet tension (sensory journey vs. emotional journey)
- A complex narrative revelation delivered through text during an action sequence (intellectual journey vs. sensory journey)

**Design principle**: Before placing any narrative element, ask which journey it serves and whether it conflicts with the other two journeys at that moment.

## Interactive Narrative Structures

### Linear

Single authored path. The player experiences the story in the designer's intended sequence. Most story-driven games use linear structure for their main narrative.

**Strengths**: Precise emotional control. The designer can craft specific pacing, specific revelations, specific beats.

**Weaknesses**: Replayability is low. The player has no agency over the story. The emergent narrative is entirely separate from the embedded narrative.

### Branching

Player choices create divergent paths. Heavy authoring cost — every branch must be written, voiced, and tested. The content requirement grows exponentially with the number of meaningful branches.

**The exponential problem**: A game with 10 meaningful choice points, each with 2 options, requires 2^10 = 1,024 unique story paths. Most branching games solve this by funneling branches back together — the illusion of choice rather than genuine divergence.

**When branching works**: When the branches are genuinely different experiences, not just cosmetically different paths to the same outcome. The player should be able to replay and experience something meaningfully different.

### Storylets / Quality-Based Narrative

**Source:** Emily Short, "Beyond Branching" (2016). The QBN/storylet pattern originated with Failbetter Games' *Fallen London* (~2009); Short named and analyzed it.

Self-contained narrative chunks that become available based on player state. The player's choices don't branch the story — they change which storylets are available.

**Strengths**: Scales better than branching because chunks can be reused across states. A storylet about "confronting an old enemy" can appear in multiple contexts. The authoring cost is proportional to the number of storylets, not the number of paths.

**Weaknesses**: The narrative can feel episodic rather than continuous. The player may notice the seams between storylets.

**Examples**: Fallen London, 80 Days, Wildermyth. These games have enormous narrative variety without the exponential authoring cost of branching.

**Why QBN scales where branching collapses**: From Emily Short's "Beyond Branching" (2016): QBN elegantly handles the case where the player needs to acquire multiple pieces of information in any order. In branching, this creates combinatorial explosion — 3 information-gathering beats produce 6 permutations, each requiring its own authored path. In QBN, it's 4 storylets: 3 information-gathering chunks plus 1 gated conclusion that fires once all three are satisfied. The authoring cost stays flat regardless of acquisition order.

QBN also enables modular content addition — new storylets can be dropped alongside existing content without destabilizing the system. This is critical for games with episodic content or multiple contributing authors. Adding a new branch in a branching structure commits you to writing every downstream consequence; adding a new storylet commits you to nothing beyond that storylet itself.

### Salience-Based Narrative

**Source:** Emily Short, "Beyond Branching" (2016). Short coined the category label "salience-based narrative" to describe a technique already in use (cf. Ruskin, GDC 2012).

The system picks the most applicable content from a pool based on world state, rather than letting the player choose. Content is tagged with conditions; the system selects the most specifically matching content for the current situation.

Unlike QBN — where the *player* chooses from available storylets — salience-based systems make that selection automatically based on context matching. More specific matches (more conditions satisfied) are preferred over general ones.

**Examples**: Left 4 Dead's AI dialogue system (Elan Ruskin, "AI-Driven Dynamic Dialog," GDC 2012). Dialogue is tagged with location, nearby objects, team health, and recent events. The system selects the most contextually appropriate line. Players rarely notice the selection — they just feel like the characters are reacting naturally. Firewatch layers reactive dialogue onto environmental exploration: the narrator comments on what the player is doing without conversation being the primary interaction.

**Key advantages**: Easy to build incrementally — start with broad defaults, then add more specific content for individual situations. You're never committed to uniform coverage for every possible state. Adding new content doesn't create ripple effects: a new line tagged for a specific situation doesn't affect any other line, the opposite of branching where every addition potentially requires downstream reconciliation.

**Key limitation**: The system can only be as good as its tagging. If the conditions don't capture the distinctions that matter narratively, the most specific match won't feel specific. Salience-based systems require careful upfront design of the condition vocabulary — what dimensions of world state are worth tracking.

### Waypoint Narrative

**Source:** Emily Short, "Beyond Branching" (2016). Implemented in Short's game *Glass*.

NPCs pathfind through a conversation topic graph toward authored story beats. The player can redirect by introducing topics NPCs don't want to discuss, diverting the narrative. The system constantly "heals" back toward authored beats.

The conversation is a graph of topics with transitions between them. Each transition has associated dialogue. NPCs have a target topic — the next story beat — and pathfind through the topic graph toward it. The player can change the current topic, forcing the NPC to find a new path. This changes what gets said, but the NPC still works toward the story beat. World state can also affect which topics are available or which beats the NPC is targeting — a character who knows the player has already discovered a secret will pathfind toward a different beat than one who doesn't.

**Key insight**: Adding more content makes the system *more* robust — more paths through the topic space means better healing toward story beats. This is the inverse of branching, where adding content commits you to writing yet more content to handle the new branch's downstream consequences.

**Useful for**: Stories with a strong narrative voice, unreliable narrators, or situations where the primary interaction is a tug-of-war between player curiosity and NPC agenda.

**Contrast with salience-based narrative**: Salience-based systems are passive — the world state triggers content automatically. Waypoint narrative is active — the NPC is pursuing a goal and the player is trying to redirect it. The player's agency is in the redirection, not the selection.

**Contrast with branching**: In branching, the designer writes every path. In waypoint narrative, the designer writes the topic graph and the story beats; the paths emerge from the NPC's pathfinding. The designer controls the destination, not the route.

### Environmental Storytelling

Narrative delivered through the world itself — item placement, architectural decay, incidental dialogue, visual design. The player discovers the story by exploring, not by being told.

**Strengths**: Narrative is integrated with gameplay. The player discovers story through the same actions they use to play the game. The intellectual journey and the narrative journey are the same journey.

**Weaknesses**: Requires players to engage actively. Players who don't explore miss the story. The narrative cannot guarantee specific emotional beats because the player controls the order of discovery.

**Examples**: Dark Souls' item descriptions, Firewatch's environmental details, Disco Elysium's world design.

### The Interaction Frontier

From Playtank's framework: games are overrated as authoring tools but underrated as experience generators. The more the designer tries to control the narrative, the less the player can generate their own. The more the designer trusts the rules to generate narrative, the more personal and memorable the player's experience becomes.

**Design implication**: Push toward emergence rather than control. Write rules that generate stories rather than stories that constrain rules. The designer's job is to create conditions for narrative, not to write the narrative itself.

## The World-Plot Interface

**Source:** Emily Short, "Tightening the World-Plot Interface" (2015).

Games have rich world models (physics, inventory, spatial relationships) and authored plots (character arcs, revelations, themes). These two layers barely interact in most games. The world model knows about objects and positions; the plot knows about character motivations and dramatic beats. The gap between them is the **world-plot interface**.

### Conversation as Bridge

Better conversation systems are one approach to bridging this gap. When NPCs reason about what the player knows, what they want to discuss, and what they're hiding, conversation becomes a gameplay system that connects world state to narrative state.

A guard NPC who knows you were seen near the crime scene creates a different conversation than one who doesn't — the world state (player position history) affects the narrative (accusation vs. small talk). This is the world-plot interface working: a fact about the world model propagates into a change in the narrative layer.

The salience-based and waypoint narrative structures described above are both mechanisms for building this bridge. Salience-based systems let world state select which narrative content fires; waypoint systems let world state determine which conversational paths are available. Both are implementations of the same underlying idea: the world model and the plot model should talk to each other.

### Dialogue Expressiveness

**Dialogue expressiveness** is how the NPC's way of speaking changes based on relationship, mood, and knowledge — not just what is said, but how it's said.

A character who is friendly says the same information differently than one who is hostile. A character who knows the player already has a piece of information skips the exposition. This requires **player knowledge management**: the system tracks what the player has been told and adjusts dialogue accordingly. It prevents the "as you already know" problem (characters re-explaining things the player already learned) and enables dramatic irony (the player knows something the character doesn't, or vice versa).

Expressiveness creates perceived depth even with limited content. A character who speaks differently based on context feels more alive than one who delivers the same lines regardless of situation — the player infers a rich inner life from the variation, even if the underlying system is simple.

**Examples**: Disco Elysium's skill system gives each internal voice a distinct personality that reacts to the same situation differently. The player's own stats become characters with opinions — the world model (skill values) directly shapes the narrative voice. This is a particularly tight world-plot interface: the same data that governs gameplay mechanics also governs who speaks and how.

**Design implication**: The richer the world-plot interface, the more the embedded and emergent narratives can harmonize — provided the plot layer is designed to handle the range of world states the player can produce. A world-plot interface that reacts to world states the plot wasn't authored to handle produces more dissonance, not less. This is exactly what ludo-narrative coherence requires: the authored narrative must respond to what the player has done, not just to what the designer expected them to do.

## Worked Example: BioShock and Dark Souls

### BioShock: Canonical Ludo-Narrative Dissonance

**Embedded narrative**: A critique of Objectivism and the illusion of free will. The game's central twist ("Would you kindly?") reveals that the player has been following orders the entire time — a commentary on blind obedience and the illusion of agency.

**Emergent narrative**: The player accumulates power, makes self-interested choices, becomes a superhuman killing machine. The Player-Subject optimizes for survival and efficiency, harvesting resources and eliminating threats.

**The dissonance**: The embedded narrative says "blind obedience is bad" while the gameplay requires blind obedience to quest markers. The narrative critiques power accumulation while the gameplay rewards it. The Antagonist (the game's unified challenge-entity) is inconsistent — the rules say "accumulate power" while the story says "power accumulation is the problem."

**Why it's still a great game**: The dissonance is partially intentional. The "Would you kindly?" twist is more powerful because the player has been blindly following orders. The dissonance is a feature of the narrative design, not a failure. But the gameplay rewards (power accumulation, self-interest) never harmonize with the narrative themes (critique of self-interest), which limits the game's coherence.

### Dark Souls: Emergent and Embedded Harmony

**Embedded narrative**: Minimal. Item descriptions, environmental details, and NPC dialogue hint at a dying world, a cycle of fire, and the player's role as undead. The story is there for players who seek it; it's invisible to players who don't.

**Emergent narrative**: The player faces adversity, struggles, learns, and eventually succeeds. Every player has a story about their playthrough — the boss that killed them twenty times, the moment they finally understood the pattern, the triumph of the final victory.

**The harmony**: The embedded narrative (a dying world, the cycle of struggle and persistence) reinforces the emergent narrative (the player's own cycle of struggle and persistence). The Antagonist is consistent — the world, the enemies, and the rules all say the same thing: *you are not welcome here, but you can learn.*

**The lesson**: Dark Souls doesn't fight its dynamics. The designers didn't write a story about overcoming adversity and then create gameplay that contradicts it. They created gameplay that generates stories of overcoming adversity, and then wrote an embedded narrative that harmonizes with those stories. The embedded and emergent narratives are the same story told at different levels.

## Diagnostic Questions

**Coherence:**
- Does the embedded narrative say the same thing as the emergent narrative?
- Do the reward structures reinforce the narrative themes?
- Is the Antagonist consistent — do the rules and the story say the same thing?

**Player-Subject:**
- Does the game acknowledge the Player-Subject's autonomy?
- Are moral choices genuine, or are they illusory?
- Does the game moralize at the player for choices the game offered?

**Three journeys:**
- Which journey does each narrative element serve?
- Does any narrative element conflict with another journey at that moment?
- Are emotional beats earned through play, or are they delivered by cutscene?

**Structure:**
- Does the narrative structure match the game's design goals?
- Is the authoring cost proportionate to the narrative value?
- Does the structure allow for emergent narrative, or does it suppress it?
- Does the condition vocabulary (tags, state flags, world model dimensions) capture the distinctions that matter narratively?
- If using waypoint narrative, is the topic graph dense enough that the NPC can always find a path toward the story beat from any player-reachable topic?

**World-plot interface:**
- Do NPCs react differently based on what the player has done and what they know?
- Does the game track player knowledge to avoid re-explaining things the player already learned?
- Is there a mechanism for world state to propagate into narrative state, or do the two layers run in parallel without touching?
